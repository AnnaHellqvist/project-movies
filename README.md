# Project Movies :clapper:

The purpose of this project was to create a multipage website using React Router. 

## The problem :boom:

### Tech I've used / What I've practiced :sparkles:
- React
- JavaScript
- React Router
- API

I started building the app.js file, adding browser-router and routes for 'MovieList' and 'MovieDetails' pages. The first page 'MovieList', viewing all the movies from the popular movies endpoint. And 'MovieDetails' viewing some detail information about the movie which is clicked on.
I added a header which contains a dropdown menu to pick other movies. To change the list I created an object that contains the option in the dropdown and the value that is needed in the API url. 
Then I created a function and a state to set the API to the choosen endpoint. 
I added a loader that should appear if the fetch is taking to long. I added a setTimeout to be able to view it. 


## View it live :tada:
